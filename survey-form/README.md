### Difficulties and Challenges

I was always curious about star rating I seen it used by reviewers for ranking things such as films, TV shows, restaurants and specially products review on (lazada,shopee and amazon). I decide to make a star rating with this project It's quite challenging because I have to make my own research sinced it's not within the course perview.

### Note to self

I still need to add a javascript to my start rating.
