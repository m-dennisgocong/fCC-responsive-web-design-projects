        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages
          interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).
          There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow
          you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between
          multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can
          be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
          and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
          Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
          objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
            browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
            application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks,
            form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
            running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application
            to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation
            to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And,
          likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in
          the browser.

      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <article>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
          The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong
          type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
          control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,
          JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing
          numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead
          of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
          also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be
          properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
          variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods
          are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
        </p>
        <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety.
          Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object
          reference or access private memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based
          model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class
          inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies.
          These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed
          languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools
          to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality,
          and minimal requirements for object creation.

      <article>
        <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your
          JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and
          creativity.
        </p>
        <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually.
          To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to your test site and create a new folder named <span class="hello-script">scripts</span>. Within the scripts folder, create a new text document called <span class="hello-script">main.js</span>, and save it.</li>
          <li>In your <span class="hello-script">index.html</span> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing
          <span class="hello-script">&lt/body&gt </span>tag:
            <code>&ltscript src="scripts/main.js"&gt</script>
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>This is doing the same job as the <span class="hello-script">&ltlink&gt </span> element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>
          <li>Add this code to the main.js file:<br> <code>const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1'); <br> myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';</code></li>
          <li>Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load index.html in your browser.</li>
        </ol>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>A variable is a named reference to a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a
          variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
        <code>
          let myVariable;
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.
          It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However,
          some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement.
          There are other rules for when you should and shouldn't use semicolons.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!</p>
        <p>
          After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
          <code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:
          <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:
          <code>myVariable;</code>
        </p>
        <p>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:
          <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';<br> myVariable = 'Steve';</code>
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
      <article>
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because
          it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function,
          it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function. </p>
        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within
          a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code
          will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block,
          which in this case is an if statement.
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        </p>
        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
          <code>
            if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
          defined
          </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
      <header>Global variables</header>
        <article>
        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window,
          so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
        </p>
        <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by
          specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
          you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
          identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
          dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        </p>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value. </p>
        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable. </p>
        <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
          <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
          CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
          }</code>
        </p>
        <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
          <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
      <header>Data types</header>
      <article>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant. </li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with
          your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
          objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <article>
        <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a
          statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        </p>
        <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates
          to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed.
          statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
        </p>
        <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
          <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
          } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code>
        </p>
        <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed.
          To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) .
          In general, it's good practice to always use block statements,
          especially when nesting if statements:
          <code>
            if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
          confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
          <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
        </p>
        <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
          <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <article>
        <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
          <code>while (condition) statement</code>
          If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
        </p>
        <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement
          is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is
          passed to the statement following while.
        </p>
        <p> To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
          <br>
          Example:
          <br>
          The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
          <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
        </p>
        <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
          <ul>
            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
          </ul>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_statement">
      <header>Function statement</header>
      <article>
        <p> A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li> A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. </li>
            <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
          <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        </p>
        <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement
          that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
          statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          <code>return number * number;</code>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
