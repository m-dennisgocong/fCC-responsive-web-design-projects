        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages
          interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).
          There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow
          you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between
          multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can
          be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
          and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
          Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
          objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
            browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
            application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks,
            form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
            running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application
            to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation
            to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And,
          likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in
          the browser.

      <article>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
          The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong
          type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
          control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,
          JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing
          numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead
          of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
          also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be
          properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
          variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods
          are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
        </p>
        <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety.
          Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object
          reference or access private memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based
          model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class
          inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies.
          These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed
          languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools
          to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality,
          and minimal requirements for object creation.

        <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your
          JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and
          creativity.
        </p>
        <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually.
          To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to your test site and create a new folder named <span class="hello-script">scripts</span>. Within the scripts folder, create a new text document called <span class="hello-script">main.js</span>, and save it.</li>
          <li>In your <span class="hello-script">index.html</span> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing
          <span class="hello-script">&lt/body&gt </span>tag:
            <code>&ltscript src="scripts/main.js"&gt</script>
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>This is doing the same job as the <span class="hello-script">&ltlink&gt </span> element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>
          <li>Add this code to the main.js file:<br> <code>const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1'); <br> myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';</code></li>
          <li>Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load index.html in your browser.</li>
        </ol>

      <p>A variable is a named reference to a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.</p>

      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a
          variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:</p>
        <code>
          let myVariable;
        </code>
        <p>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.
          It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However,
          some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement.
          There are other rules for when you should and shouldn't use semicolons.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!</p>
        <p>
          After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
          <code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:
          <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:
          <code>myVariable;</code>
        </p>
        <p>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:
          <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';<br> myVariable = 'Steve';</code>
        </p>
