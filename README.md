# freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Projects

This repo will contain all my Responsive Web Design Project. By working on these projects, I will get the chance to apply all the skills, principles, and concepts I have learned from: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.

## Objective and User Stories

Each of the project have different objective and user stories. I will be given a sample app and build it with my own personal style but make sure to fulfill the user stories and get all of the test pass.
