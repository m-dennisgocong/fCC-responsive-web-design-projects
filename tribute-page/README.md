## Project Objective

Build a web that is similar to this: <a href="https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/" target="_blank"> https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/ </a>

## Difficulties and Challenges

I remade the project multiple times because I'm not satified with my UI designs. I took some time learning the basic UI fundamentals, joining community with UI designers to enable to improve and understand the aspect of web designing. I learned how to use figma as my desgining tool.

## Note

I used a lot of dev's on this project. I should apply HTML Semantic for best practice and avoid using a lot of dev's. Applying different unit type on the same element can cause conflict.
