### Difficulties and Challenges

I was always curious about star rating I seen it's used by reviewers for ranking things such as films, TV shows, restaurants and specially products review on (lazada,shopee and amazon). I decide to make a star rating with this project It's quite challenging I have to make my own research on how to implement it since it's not on this course.
